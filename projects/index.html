                <p>
                    I am in my senior year as a Managment Information Systems and Accounting major at the University of Oklahoma. During my time at
                    OU I have been serving as a mechanical lead for Sooner Competative Robotics. Here my duties have primarilly consisted of
                    overseeing teams of mechanical engineers and working along side them to create robots to compete in competitions across
                    the United States.

                <h3>MIS 3303 Classwork</h3>
                <p>
                    During the Fall of 2019, I completed an MIS course focused on furthering my understanding of programming and web development. This class involved programming based projects scaling from simple 2 or 3 hour assignments
                    to a much larger multi-week group project. My final project involved the creation of a program designed to allow a professor to quickly generate homwork assignments based on a list of previously input questions
                    and answers.
                </p>

                <h3>Database Construction Project</h3>
                <p>
                    In the Spring of 2019, I completed a systems and databases course at The University of Oklahoma. The class was focused on one project that took place over the entire semester wherein we designed, implemented, and
                    revised a database to meet a fabricated customer's needs. For the project we utilized Lucidchart for flowcharting and Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio for the actual database.
                </p>

                <h3>Ongoing Personal Project</h3>
                <p>
                    Throughout my life I have always enjoyed role playing games such as Dungeons & Dragons, but have always found character creation tedious. To remedy this problem, in the Spring of 2019, I began work on a WPF application
                    that could fully generate a Dungons & Dragons 5th edition character complete with rolled stats, a complete backstory, and fully selected inventory. This project is ongoing but can be found in my Github repository
                    dedicated to Dungons & Dragons related projects.
